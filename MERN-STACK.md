## Introduction
MERN stack is the name given to a set of JavaScript based technologies used in developing web applications. MERN is the acronym name given to the set of technologies including Mongo DB, Express JS, React JS and Node JS. Among these technologies Mongo DB is a database system, Node JS is a back-end runtime environment, Express JS is a back-end web framework and React is a front-end framework.A stack is the combination of technologies used to create a web application. Any web application will be made using multiple technologies (frameworks, libraries, databases etc). The MERN stack is a JavaScript stack that’s designed to make the development process smoother. MERN includes four open-source components: MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js. These components provide an end-to-end framework for developers to work in.  

### Components of MERN-STACK
* #### Mango DB
    * Mongo DB is a free and open-source cross-platform document-oriented database program. Classified as a No SQL database program, Mongo DB uses JSON-like documents with schemata. 
    * Mongo DB is developed by Mongo DB Inc., and is published under a combination of the GNU Affero General Public License and the Apache License. MongoDB is an open-source, document database that provides persistence for your application data and is designed with both scalability and developer agility in mind. 
    * MongoDB bridges the gap between key-value stores, which are fast and scalable, and relational databases, which have rich functionality. Instead of storing data in rows and columns as one would with a relational database, MongoDB stores JSON documents in collections with dynamic schemas.

* #### Express JS
    * Express is the web application framework that runs your back-end application (JavaScript) code. Express runs as a module within the Node.js environment. Express can handle the routing of requests to the right parts of your application (or to different apps running in the same environment).

    * You can run the app's full business logic within Express and even generate the final HTML to be rendered by the user's browser. At the other extreme, Express can be used to simply provide a REST API – giving the front-end app access to the resources it needs e.g., the database.

    * Express will perform two functions:
        * Send the front-end application code to the remote browser when the user browses to our app.
        * Provide a REST API that the front-end can access using HTTP network calls, in order to access the database.

* #### React JS
    * React (also known as React.js or React JS) is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It is maintained by Facebook and a community of individual developers and companies.
    * React can be used as a base in the development of single-page or mobile applications. Complex React applications usually require the use of additional libraries for state management, routing, and interaction with an API.
    * Redux is an open-source JavaScript library for managing application state. It is most commonly used with libraries such as React or Angular for building user interfaces. Similar to (and inspired by) Facebook's Flux architecture, it was created by Dan Abramov and Andrew Clark.

* #### Node JS
    * Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript run-time environment that executes JavaScript code outside of a browser. Historically, JavaScript was used primarily for client-side scripting, in which scripts written in JavaScript are embedded in a webpage's HTML and run client-side by a JavaScript engine in the user's web browser. 
    * Node.js lets developers use JavaScript to write Command Line tools and for server-side scripting—running scripts server-side to produce dynamic web page content before the page is sent to the user's web browser. Consequently, Node.js represents a "JavaScript everywhere" paradigm, unifying web application development around a single programming language, rather than different languages for server side and client side scripts.
    * Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment that runs your back-end application (via Express). Node.js is based on Google's V8 JavaScript engine which is used in the Chrome browsers. It also includes a number of modules that provides features essential for implementing web applications – including networking protocols such as HTTP. Third party modules, including the MongoDB driver, can be installed, using the npm tool.


### Benefits of MERN-STACK
* The main advantage for developers using the MERN stack is that every line of code is written in JavaScript. This is a programming language that’s used everywhere, both for client-side code and server-side code. With one language across tiers, there’s no need for context switching.

* For tech stack with multiple programming languages, developers have to figure out how to interface them together. With the JavaScript stack, developers only need to be proficient in JavaScript and JSON.

* Using the MERN stack enables developers to build highly efficient web applications.
